abstract = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.}

abstract="The Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is a popular tool for robust estimation problems in computer vision, primarily due to its ability to tolerate a tremendous fraction of outliers. There have been a number of recent efforts that aim to increase the efficiency of the standard RANSAC algorithm. Relatively fewer efforts, however, have been directed towards formulating RANSAC in a manner that is suitable for real-time implementation. The contributions of this work are two-fold: First, we provide a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art RANSAC algorithms and categorize the various approaches. Second, we develop a powerful new framework for real-time robust estimation. The technique we develop is capable of efficiently adapting to the constraints presented by a fixed time budget, while at the same time providing accurate estimation over a wide range of inlier ratios. The method shows significant improvements in accuracy and speed over existing techniques.",

abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},
